<p>Saving money as a single mom requires a lot of patience and discipline. Learning how to manage your finances may sometimes be an intimidating task, especially if you’re going solo. But, not all hope is lost. Once you get a firm grip on your budget, saving money will come naturally.<br>

To help you get started, here are five money-saving tips for you to try.</font><br></p>
<h1>Record Your Monthly Income and Expenses</h1>
<img src="1.webp">
<p><font face="edwardian script itc" size="15px" color=black>The first step to understanding your finances is to take a look at where your money is going. How much do you earn every month, after-tax? List down all your sources of income and compute for the ending after-tax amount. Then, figure out what you’re mostly spending for – this means recording every cup of coffee you buy, cash tips, and weekly grocery bills.<br>

Your list doesn’t need to be fancy. You can use a spreadsheet to do this, or a plain ol’ notebook. There are also a lot of apps that offer automated expense trackers for you, too. Once you have all your data complete, track which kind of expense takes the most of your income. Then, plan how you can bring it lower.</font></p>
<h1>Plan How to Cut Down the Unnecessary Expenses</h1>
<p><font face="edwardian script itc" size="15px" color=black>As soon as you get an overview of where your after-tax monthly income goes, identify your nonessential expenses, and plan how to cut them down. Examples of such expenses are the following:
<ul>
<li> Cancelling subscriptions and memberships that you don’t use</li>
<li>Reducing family entertainment expenses that are not considered a priority</li>
<li>Committing to eat out or order food deliveries for the family only once or twice a week</li>
<li>Making your own cup of coffee for work instead of buying from expensive cafés</li>
<li>Cook at home and pack food for work and school instead of eating out or ordering food deliveries for the family</li>
</ul>
Are you easily swayed by impulsive expenses? To save money better, you need to practice self-discipline and spend intentionally. This means letting go of buying fancy things that you and your family don’t really need at the moment.

<h1>Create a Sustainable Monthly Budget</h1>
<img src="2.webp">
<p><font face="edwardian script itc" size="15px" color=black>Once you already have a record on your fixed expenses, create a sustainable budget for your daily expenses. NerdWallet recommends the 50/30/20 budget. In this technique, you spend 50 percent of your after-tax income on essential expenses like child care expenses, groceries, medicines, utilities, and insurance.<br>

Then, spend no more than 30 percent of your income on wants like expenses on entertainment, eating out, and travel. Lastly, commit 20 percent of your income on savings and debt repayments. This is where you build up your emergency savings fund, which could be around three to six month’s worth of your family’s living expenses.<br>

Don’t forget to put some wiggle room in your budget as well. Remember that your budget is a tool that helps you keep afloat and not a wall that keeps you from enjoying life. Set aside a bit of money for fun, so you wouldn’t hate following your budget. This will help you avoid living from paycheck to paycheck.</font></p>
<h1>Save Before Spending</h1>
<p><font face="edwardian script itc" size="15px" color=black>Every month, before paying for your expenses, earmark a specific amount for your savings and set it aside. It doesn’t matter how small your planned savings is, as long as you won’t be able to touch it. You can choose a specific percentage of your monthly income for savings. As guided by Bank of America, aim to save at least 10 to 15% of your income.<br>

For example, if you’re earning $1,000 a month, set aside around $150 for savings. You may opt to transfer it to another savings account so you can’t touch it. Almost all banks offer automatic transfers between checking and savings accounts. Take advantage of this service to lessen the temptation to spend all your money.</font></p>
<h1>Choose the Right Tools</h1>
<img src="3.webp">
<p><font face="edwardian script itc" size="15px" color=black>To maximize your savings, there are different types of deposit and low-risk investment accounts that can help your savings earn interest on its own.<br>

For short-term savings, you can choose among the following FDIC-insured options:
<ul>
<li> Bank savings account</li>
<li>Certificate of Deposit account</li>
<li>Checking accounts (including Money market deposit account)</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, for long-term savings, here are some of your options:
<ul>
<li>Mutual funds investments</li>
<li>Stocks, bonds, and annuities</li>
<li>FDIC-insured investment retirement account (IRA)</li>
</ul>
The financial struggles of a single mom may sometimes be daunting. Not being able to pay for fixed expenses is every mom’s nightmare. As long as you create a sustainable budget, practice spending intentionally, and set aside even just a bit of money for savings, you can avoid living from paycheck to paycheck.
